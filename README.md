# Sensor-Controlled-Fighting-Game-Interface
An unconventional physical game controller built with Arduino. This project maps real-world body movements—such as kicks, steps, and gestures—into keyboard inputs using PIR, pressure, and IR sensors. The controller is integrated with a 2D fighting game (M.U.G.E.N) to enable immersive interaction through physical actions.
# Sensors used
- PIR motion sensor (HC-SR501)
- Pressure film sensors (2 x RP-C7.6-LT)
- Infrared proximity sensor (E18-D80NK)
- Arduino Leonardo (for HID keyboard emulation)
Designed for a university course on interaction design and physical computing.
