# Sensor-Controlled-Fighting-Game-Interface
An unconventional physical game controller built with Arduino. This project maps real-world body movements—such as kicks, steps, and gestures—into keyboard inputs using PIR, pressure, and IR sensors. The controller is integrated with a 2D fighting game (M.U.G.E.N) to enable immersive interaction through physical actions.
